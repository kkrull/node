# Node.js Sandbox

I started a new project based on Node.js and had to learn a lot of new libraries.
This repository attempts to learn them one at a time, or to touch upon a single integration point between two libraries at a time.

Most examples are taken straight from that library's tutorials; there's not a whole lot of original content.
But there's nothing quite like writing the code myself and making it dance.

Most of the projects have some mechanism for exercising it, short of opening a web page in a browser.  
Try `npm test` in each directory to see what the example is doing, and then look at the code.  
It is - by design - focused only on learning one thing, so there's not much source code in each example.
